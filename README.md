# Loan-Predictoin-Using-Python
The problem: Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan. The Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. It’s a classification problem , given information about the application I  have to predict whether the they’ll be to pay the loan or not. I started by exploratory data analysis , then preprocessing , and finally I tested  different models such as Logistic regression and decision trees.
